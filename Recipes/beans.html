    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups dried beans (black beans, pinto beans, or kidney beans)</li>
        <li>6 cups water (for soaking and cooking)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the Beans
            Rinse the dried beans under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Place them in a large bowl, cover with water, and let them soak overnight (8–12 hours). Drain and rinse before cooking.
            </li>
        <li>Cook the Beans
            In a large pot, add the soaked beans and 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Add the bay leaf and simmer for 1–1.5 hours, or until the beans are tender. Drain the beans and set them aside, discarding the bay leaf.
            </li>
        <li> Prepare the Seasoning Base
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 3–4 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic, cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder (if using), cooking for 1 minute until fragrant.
            </li>
        <li>Combine Beans with Seasoning
            Add the cooked beans to the skillet along with the diced tomatoes (if using). Stir well to combine and allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes, letting the flavors meld. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
            </li>
        <li>Serve and Garnish
            Remove the skillet from heat and garnish with fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve the beans warm as a main dish, side dish, or filling for tacos and wraps. Enjoy! -->
