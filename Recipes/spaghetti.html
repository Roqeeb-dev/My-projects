    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cook the Spaghetti
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and set aside.
            </li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce Base
            In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Seasonings
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and red chili flakes (if using). Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
        <li>Combine Spaghetti and Sauce
            Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the sauce. Toss gently to coat the spaghetti evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve
            Remove the skillet from heat. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan che</li>
    </ol>
