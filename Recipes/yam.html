        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional, for sweet recipes)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional, for sweet recipes)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for savory recipes)</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional, for savory recipes)</li>
        <li> Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (optional, for sweet recipes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Yams
            Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash and peel the yams, then cut them into bite-sized cubes or rounds, depending on your preference.
            </li>
        <li>Season the Yams
            In a large bowl, toss the yam pieces with olive oil or melted butter. For a sweet dish, add cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey or maple syrup. For a savory dish, use smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to coat evenly.
            </li>
        <li>Roast the Yams
            Spread the seasoned yams in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the yams are golden brown and tender when pierced with a fork.
            </li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve
            Remove the yams from the oven and garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or thyme, if desired. Serve hot as a side dish or main course and enjoy!
